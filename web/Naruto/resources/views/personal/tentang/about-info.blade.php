                    Hi friends! 
                    <p>My name is Waode Makani Daga. I'm going to introduce myself. I have born and grown up in Gowa and I'm studying 5 years Software Engeering in this prestigeous college, STMIK KHARISMA MAKASSAR. As for my family, I am an only child. My father is a Sailor. My mother has been taking care of house hold.</p>
                    <p>I am a friendly person, imaginer, on time in any activities. I can work for longer minutes while listening to my favorite songs , only if I'm interested that...My life style is very simple. I'm interested in many things such as music, drawing, watching movies. I love to drawing some pictures or animation characters and suspense think how it looks like. I wanna improve my imagine skills. I'm glad to have those activities. My other hobbies including being with my things in a bedroom.</p>
                    <p>I'm personally interested in Database Administrator although my major in college is a programmer, however, there are many different career opportunities. I believe that a job should be like a hobby. It takes a long time to study software classes. It is very difficult and requires a tremendous amount of patience and hard work. I hope that I'll be able to meet these challenges, and that my dream will come true.</p>
                    <p>As for now I'm only focusing my attention on enjoyment. I'm being my true self with the values, dreams and goals that I have....</p>

                    so this is 'Me' talking in this page to all of you. Thank you...
                    Friends!
